			<p>Bellarri, the woman and designer, as well as her jewelry, is an industry leader for trend setting design and quality workmanship. She stands a cut above by continuing to dazzle the world with her sensational designs. Her distinctive and breathtaking collections promote her philosophy as a "Designer of Art", and not simply "beautiful baubles".</p>
			
			<p>Bellarri uses semi-precious, laser-cut, multi-stones in her "Mosaic Collection" and her "Colors of Passion Collection". According to Bellarri, it is her intent "that every piece in her collections should be the epitome of elegance and heirloom quality."</p>

			<p>Romance and dreams are alive and well in this designer, as Bellarri thoughtfully states, "If my designs elicit images of romance and dreams of far away places, perhaps it is because these have always been a part of my life. I am the direct result of a woman following her heart."</p>
