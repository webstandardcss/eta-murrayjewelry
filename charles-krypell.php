			<p>It's not surprising that Charles Krypell was a sculptor before he became an internationally renowned jewelry designer. Looking at his exquisite, perfectly balanced jewelry, it's clear that one artistic craft flows seamlessly into the other.</p>

			<p>"I create jewelry like I would a film set: with mood, drama, and my customers wear the jewelry like actresses." "When I design jewelry I think of women as film stars. I want them to be observed, envied, and admired."</p>
