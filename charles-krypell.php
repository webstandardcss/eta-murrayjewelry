			<h2 class="text-center">Charles Krypell</h2>
						<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising that Charles Krypell was a sculptor before he became an internationally renowned jewelry designer. In his exquisite, perfectly balanced jewelry, it&rsquo;s clear that one artistic craft flows seamlessly into the other.</p>			
							<blockquote>
			<p>&ldquo;I create jewelry like I would a film set: with mood, drama, and my customers wear the jewelry like actresses.&rdquo;</p>
			<p> &ldquo;When I design jewelry I think of women as film stars. I want them to be observed, envied, and admired.&rdquo;</p>
