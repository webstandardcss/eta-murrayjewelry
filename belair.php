			<h2 class="text-center">Belair</h2>
			
			<p>For over 65 years Belair has been a highly respected manufacturer of popular priced, high quality timepieces. Belair is a third generation firm started in 1946, that has build a reputation for honesty, integrity and reliability.</p>

			<p>Continuing this tradition, current President Alan Grunwald, grandson of the founder, joined the company in 1974. Without the burden of a huge advertising budget, he was able to concentrate his focus on quality and superior design. While others cheapened their watches to appeal to a mass market, Belair watches became better, and kept their focus on a smaller more select market, the independent retail jeweler. Belair watches are stronger and more durable, their bands heavier and more resistant to wear, and their packaging more elegant and luxurious than their name brand competition. They use Swiss components, and double and triple check them to ensure consistent quality; all at a reasonable cost.</p>
